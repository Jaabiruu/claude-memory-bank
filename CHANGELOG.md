## [1.0.0] - 2024-06-04

### Added
- Complete Claude Code adaptation of cursor-memory-bank methodology by @vanzan01
- 6-mode workflow system (VAN, PLAN, CREATIVE, IMPLEMENT, REFLECT, ARCHIVE)
- Complexity-based routing (Level 1-4) with automatic workflow path determination
- File-based configuration system for Claude Code integration
- Global installation system with one-line installer
- Project setup automation with `claude-memory-setup` command
- Comprehensive mode instruction files with mandatory actions and quality gates
- Creative phase integration using Claude's "Think" methodology
- Context preservation across Claude Code sessions via persistent files
- Automation enhancements with pattern detection and decision extraction
- Cross-project learning and pattern sharing capabilities

### Core Files
- `claude.md` - Complete Claude Code configuration with mode definitions
- `starter-prompt.md` - Initialization guide for first-time users
- `install.sh` - Global installation script with shell integration
- `setup-memory-bank.sh` - Project-specific setup automation
- `memory-bank/custom_modes/` - Six specialized mode instruction files
- `memory-bank/scripts/auto-update.py` - Automation and enhancement scripts

### Mode System
- **VAN Mode**: Project initialization and complexity assessment (MANDATORY entry point)
- **PLAN Mode**: Detailed implementation planning with creative component identification
- **CREATIVE Mode**: Structured design exploration with systematic option analysis
- **IMPLEMENT Mode**: Systematic code building with continuous progress tracking
- **REFLECT Mode**: Quality validation and lessons learned capture
- **ARCHIVE Mode**: Knowledge preservation and workflow completion (Level 3-4)

### Workflow Routing
- **Level 1**: VAN → IMPLEMENT (Quick bug fixes, < 30 minutes)
- **Level 2**: VAN → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → REFLECT (Simple enhancements, 2-8 hours)
- **Level 3**: VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT → REFLECT → ARCHIVE (Complex features, 1-3 days)
- **Level 4**: VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT → REFLECT → ARCHIVE (System architecture, 1+ weeks)

### Key Features
- **tasks.md as Sacred Source of Truth**: Central task tracking that cannot be bypassed
- **Mandatory Action Enforcement**: Each mode has required actions that must be completed
- **Quality Gate System**: Exit criteria must be met before mode transitions
- **Context Preservation**: File-based memory system maintains state across sessions
- **Creative Phase Rigor**: Level 3-4 components must complete full design exploration
- **Automation Integration**: Pattern detection, decision extraction, and maintenance tools

### Attribution
- Original methodology by @vanzan01 (cursor-memory-bank)
- Claude Code adaptation preserves 100% of workflow integrity
- File-based configuration system enables Claude Code integration
- Enhanced with automation and cross-project learning capabilities

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with examples and troubleshooting
- Detailed mode instructions with step-by-step processes
- Installation and setup guides for various environments
- Contributing guidelines for community development
- MIT License with proper attribution to original methodology
