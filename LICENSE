ATTRIBUTION NOTICE:

This project is an adaptation of the original "cursor-memory-bank" methodology
created by @vanzan01 (https://github.com/vanzan01/cursor-memory-bank).

The core workflow methodology, including the 6-mode system (VAN, PLAN, CREATIVE,
IMPLEMENT, REFLECT, ARCHIVE) and complexity-based routing, was originally 
developed by @vanzan01 for Cursor IDE.

This adaptation preserves 100% of the original workflow integrity while adapting
the delivery mechanism for Claude Code's file-based configuration system.
